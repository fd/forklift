<p>Here is a footnote reference,<a class="noteref" id="fnref1" href="#fn1" title="Jump to note 1">[1]</a> and another.<a class="noteref" id="fnref2" href="#fn2" title="Jump to note 2">[2]</a></p>

<p>This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.</p>

<hr/>
<ol id="notes">

<li id="fn1">
<p>Here is the footnote.</p> <a href="#fnref1" title="Jump back to reference">[back]</a>
</li>

<li id="fn2">
<p>Here's one with multiple blocks.</p>

<p>Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.</p>

<pre><code>{ some.code }
</code></pre>

<p>The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
multi-paragraph list items.</p> <a href="#fnref2" title="Jump back to reference">[back]</a>
</li>

</ol>
